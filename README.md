Spurred on from a Wired article, a few discussions with others about some recent developments, and some stuff I'm doing at work... I'm going to attempt to leverage GitHub as a clearinghouse for LGBT (especially T) related laws, policies, frameworks, templates and such that can assist the community in getting their collective "sh*t" together in a public and editable/contributable format.

This comes about after about three years in the community and folks constantly trying to figure out the "right way" to do things and tracking egla and other changes for filing paperwork, dealing with appeals, and other administrative issues. It can also be used a a resource for those who are struggling to get started or have run into roadblocks along the way, whether it be in a large metro area or the tiniest of towns.

With things heating up with health insurance (and this can be expanded to the international arena) - it's good to track "what works, and what doesn't" since it's a complex mess out there. I hope to expand this to be a bit more inclusive, but I'd hope that folks who are geeky enough now to use it, will help in building this repository and have a community to support it.
